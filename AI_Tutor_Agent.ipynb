        "# Task\n",
        "Develop an AI-powered 24/7 tutor that can explain math, science, coding, and languages in both English and Urdu. The tutor should be able to use specific school textbooks in PDF format (e.g., Oxford, Cambridge, PTB, NCERT) as its knowledge base. To make the learning experience more engaging and effective, the tutor must incorporate relevant videos, images, and diagrams into its explanations. The interaction should be conversational and interactive, leveraging the OpenAI SDK for its large language model capabilities. The ultimate goal is to create an educational tool that can reduce the need for private tuitions and provide equal learning opportunities for students in both urban and rural areas."

        "* The application can load PDF documents and extract their text content, forming the basis of its knowledge base.\n",
        "* A user-friendly chatbot interface was created using Gradio, allowing for interactive communication.\n",
        "* The chatbot supports both English and Urdu, with a user interface element for language selection.\n",
        "* The OpenAI API was integrated to provide intelligent, context-aware responses to student questions based on the textbook content.\n",
        "* The chatbot's functionality was enhanced to include the display of images, which can be used for diagrams and other visual aids.\n",
        "* The conversation flow was designed to be engaging and encouraging by setting a friendly and supportive persona for the AI tutor.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "* Now that the core components are in place, the next step is to combine them into a single, cohesive application. This involves integrating the PDF loading, multilingual support, OpenAI-powered responses, and multimedia display into one seamless user experience.\n",
        "* To improve the accuracy and relevance of the tutor's responses, it would be beneficial to implement a more advanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. This would involve creating vector embeddings of the textbook content to enable more efficient and accurate searching for relevant information.\n"
